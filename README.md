# Blackjack Game

Welcome to my Blackjack game project! This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic casino card game Blackjack, where you can play against the computer. The game follows standard Blackjack rules.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enjoy a game of Blackjack, please ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. Python is the programming language used to run this game. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To check if you have Python installed, open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command:

`python --version`

## How to Play

1. Run the `blackjack.py` script to start the game.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
3. Try to beat the computer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over!

## Features

- You can draw additional cards ('hit') or pass ('stand') during your turn.
- The computer follows a basic strategy, drawing cards until it reaches a certain score threshold.
- The game will display the final hands and determine the winner.
